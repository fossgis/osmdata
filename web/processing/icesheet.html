<h1>Antarctic icesheet processing</h1>

<img class="right" src="/img/antarctic-ice.png" width="240" height="197" title="Ice and ice free areas in Antarctica" />

<p>Land in the Antarctic is more than 90 percent covered by ice.  It was
therefore <a
href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Antarctica/Tagging">decided some time
ago</a> in OpenStreetMap that the ice cover in general is not to be explicitly
mapped and instead it is assumed that all land (as mapped by the <a
href="/processing/coastline.html">coastline</a>) is ice-covered south of 60
degrees southern latitude unless it is explicitly mapped otherwise.</p>

<p>This convention simplifies mapping a lot but it also produces some
difficulties for data users since they need to take this into account if they
want to correctly interpret the OpenStreetMap data.</p>

<p>If you render a map displaying glaciers and icesheets based on OpenStreetMap
data you can either modify the rendering style locally in the Antarctic to take
care of the different tagging rules or you use the <a
href="/data/icesheet.html">Antarctic icesheet data provided here</a> in
addition to the normal glacier polygons from OpenStreetMap.</p>

<p>The icesheet data here essentially contains a set of polygons and
corresponding outlines of the ice-covered areas not explicitly mapped.</p>

<p>This is generated by processing the land polygon data and the landcover
mapping of the area from OpenStreetMap with
<a href="https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index">spatialite</a>.
The processing scripts are <a
href="https://github.com/imagico/icesheet_proc">available on github</a> as Open
Source.</p>

<h2>Rendering example</h2>

<p>Here a rendering example from the OpenStreetMap standard style, on the left
without the icesheet polygons, on the right with them - rendered using the same
styling as for normal glaciers.</p>
