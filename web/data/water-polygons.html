<h1>Water polygons</h1>

<p>Polygons for oceans and seas. These polygons are split into smaller
overlapping chunks that are easier and faster to work with.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The data has been derived from OpenStreetMap ways tagged with
<tt>natural=coastline</tt>. Ways are assembled into polygons and then
split. Some errors in the OSM data are repaired in the process.
<a href="/processing/coastline.html">Learn more about the coastline processing...</a></p>

<p>This dataset only contains bodies of water bordered by ways tagged
<tt>natural=coastline</tt>, it does not contain lakes, reservoirs, etc.
tagged with <tt>natural=water</tt> etc.</p>

<p>Where polygons have been split they overlap slightly to help avoiding
rendering artefacts at the seams.</p>

<h2>Variants</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The data is available in <a href="/info/projections.html#wgs84">WGS84</a>
    and <a href="/info/projections.html#mercator">Mercator</a>
    projection.</li>
